      <h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130213215711/www.costik.com/nowords.html" target="blank">What is a word, anyhow?</a> And what is in name? A word is a thought given a name.</h3>

        But what is this? This is a <i>Machine of Living Words</i>, an icon of inscription as well as an epitaph of technology from days gone by. 
        Its function is far from that of the first computers, yet its form is indicative of them all the same. Just as those early machines required one to enter a string of commands
        one value at a time through toggle switches or in bulk via punch cards before entering it, so to must the user of this "machine" enter the characters of each
         word they wish to write in the basic format of binary.

        Unlike Jonathan Basile's <a class="show" href="http://libraryofbabel.info/" target="blank">Library of Babel</a>, every single one of the words found here has
        two inherent meanings. Each word here has a meaning that is established, one which comes from the intent of the one who wrote it, even if that meaning 
        is no meaning at all. Each also has a meaning that is interpreted, one which comes from the one who reads it. The words found in the Library of Babel
        have no established meaning, because those words are created by an algorithm and therefore are brought into existence without the involvement of a 
        conscious decision, other than that of the person choosing to view the website of course. The words here, however, are brought into existence because
        someone chose to place them here, and that is what gives them life.
